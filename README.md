# Golf
# Prior to 5/24/24 To Play, you have to use the swing button to and then choose the club that you want and the power out of 10. You can also click on the scorecard button to see the score card. (Score card still defective at the moment). To move on to the next hole, just move the hole you are on out of the way by moving the window and continue playing. Game still a bit defective with the ball when it is not in line with the hole but it is pretty playable when the experience is set to 10. If you ever find yourself at a point that you are in line with the hole or behind it, the putter will fix your problems even if you are not on the green. Have fun playing.

# Updated 5/24/24. Changed the player class to take a position and allow a direction to hit the ball to aim toward the hole automatically. Might add something to allow the player to set the direction they are facing. Hopefully I will be able to make courses that are not straight in the future and actually have real dimensions.
